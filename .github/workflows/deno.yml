    steps:
      # 1️⃣ Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2️⃣ Set up Deno (official action)
      - name: Setup Deno
        uses: denoland/setup-deno@v2
        with:
          deno-version: v2.x   # or a specific version, e.g. 2.0.0

      # 3️⃣ Install any dependencies (if you use a lockfile)

      # 4️⃣ Run your custom build command
      #    Adjust this to match how you bundle / transpile your app.
      #    Common patterns:
      #      deno task build          # if you have a task in deno.json
      #      deno bundle src/main.ts dist/bundle.js
      - name: Build the app
        run: |
          # Example using a deno task defined in deno.json
          deno task build

          # Or, if you don’t have a task, bundle manually:
          # deno bundle src/main.ts dist/bundle.js

      # 5️⃣ Upload the built artifact for Deno Deploy to consume
